Task 1 - Making a simple webserver:

Files:
server.py & index.html

Description:
The code implements the socket module and listens for incomming TCP connections.
When we recieve the HTTP request from client, it attempts to retrieve the file requested. If the file exists we get a HTTP code 200 (OK). If the file is not there we get the 404 error (Not Found).

See the image "Task1-proof.png".

Task 2 - Making a web client:

Files:
client.py & testTask2.txt

Description:
This code is a HTTP client which interacts with a web server. We begin with prompting the user for the IP, port and name of the file we want to request. With this information we establish a TCP-connection to a server.

Task 3 - Making a multi-threaded web server:

Files:
multi-server.py

Description:
The python file sets up a multi-threaded TCP-server that listens for incomming ocnnections with a max queue at 5.
We also have a simple error-handling to manage exceptions and close the server, then return either 200 or 404.

Used https://github.com/safiqul/2410/blob/main/thread/tcpserver-multi.py for inspiration.
